Trees are extraordinary in their capacity to absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) through photosynthesis. On average, a single tree can absorb around 48 pounds (22 kilograms) of CO2 annually. Forests, composed of numerous trees, act as carbon sinks, storing significant amounts of carbon and helping combat climate change. By preserving existing forests and planting more trees, we can make a substantial impact in reducing greenhouse gas concentrations and creating a greener, more sustainable future.
